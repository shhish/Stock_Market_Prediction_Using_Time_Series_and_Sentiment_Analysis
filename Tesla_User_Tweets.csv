I can't see adding bidirectional charging adding much cost. Especially if it's on the DC side as all you do is close the contacts and have the inverter on the wall. Again, I'm mostly thinking load shifting. Off grid is another story.

Check Plugshare. Lots of campgrounds in the area. We stayed at Ruby's over spring break (hotel, campground wasn't open yet). They have some NEMA 14-50 options as well as some dedicated Tesla chargers.  Right by the entrance to Bryce

Yes, how much does your car consume in one year to cover your driving needs?

When you calculate like 10% less consumption because of the heat pump you can see if it's worth to replace the car when you drive it for like 8 years or so. :)

Thanks for the great metric. We'd prefer 3+Y but it's just too expensive. Even trading the 3 for the Y seems a bit too expensive. Obviously a luxury car in general is not the wisest use of funds, but increasing car payment for a slightly bigger but overall similar car... Eh

It should cut the heating power roughly in half, since it can harvest the heat generated by the motors. I the coldest month your range usually drops around 40% - if your not preheating the car before you leave.

On my typical 2hour drive to work, my M3LR AWD consumes about 450Wh/mi (20degree C)- but I'm not really slow with up to 130mph. When going more slowly like 85mph, consumption is still at approx. 350Wh/mi. Even if I try, I never had below 250Wh/mi on a typical German road mix.

Could have bought any of them, chose the SR+. If you dont need the extra range the LR doesnt offer enough extra to be worth the money to me and I dont care about the 0-60 time.
Has full autopilot (FSD is a seperate thing) and the satellite map is a paid option on all models

My old 40kw Leaf had plenty of range despite my 60 mile commute so the SR+ is almost overkill.

I think raising the SR+ charge speed to 170kw made the LR slightly less attractive if you only occasional do long drives. If you regularly do more than 200 miles it's a no brainer tho

As most of you know I avg 6500km a month (b4 Covid) all over Ontario and overnight at hotels. No issues with the car , I can say I have seen 30% less mileage in really bad temps minus 25 and driving in snow.

Also to clarify my response. New Tesla S/X vehicles seem to have fixed this issue from what I‚Äôve heard. Try and get MCU 2 if Tesla wants you to replace. MCU 2 is being reserved for FSD customers but see if you can get on a preemptive waitlist on good faith.

I guess you could call me that. Not very nice though.  A socket is easy to find. Even a domestic socket would work, depending on your driving. If you live near one of those V3 chargers 150 miles is pretty good in 13 minutes. That's more than half way up the country in Ireland!

Faster is a relative term. The Taycan charges to 80% slightly faster, but can't go as far as the Tesla when it's charged. So if you had to race to charge up for a 250-mile drive, the Tesla wins, because it charges faster.

I live in SF and honestly the roads are PTSD even with good suspension. The problem is that the car when jolted has to oscillate up and down before it stabilizes. With electromagnetic suspension you basically can eleminate that completely

New update includes mind reading!!!   Glad that your daily commute issues are solved. But I just updated to 2020.20.12...  the ‚Äútake off from stop sign‚Äù when you can‚Äôt see doesn‚Äôt seem solved.  I tried ‚Äúcreep‚Äù and ‚Äúroll‚Äù options instead of ‚Äúhold‚Äù but no difference.

That just adjusts how the car behaves at low speeds. Creep mode will creep forward unless you press the break, roll mode is like you put the car in neutral, and hold mode stops completely and then brakes so it doesn‚Äôt roll.

It's not a concern with Tesla.  It is with other EVs, which is why the other competitors are all PHEVs, except the Kona.  It suffers the same Supercharger issue, but at least its range is well over 200 in the crossover market.

Sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers- barely $200-300 mil

Maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies- All these things are under warranty! Leasimg companies don't own a penny!

This exact issue (+incompetent Tesla service) led to me returning my Y. After 2 days, they couldn't replicate (w/notifications on screen). I snapped & showed video & they replaced the latch/sensor, & it continued. A $55k car shouldn't have so many issues. Of course, I'll be back.

Spacex  is getting $10M of stuff - the taxpayers are paying for $2M of it....And getting nothing.

People of New York spent $800M and got zippo, wrote the whole thing off as a loss...

If Spacex needs the stuff they can pay for it solo..

Same but it was many ago like 8 months ago.  It was something like the cooling mechanism leaves old condensation moisture smelling like a dirty wet sock.  Originally said try to go a week not using the recycle air & use fresh outside air to blow it out.  Give it a try.

1. ILSs are not installed to all airports.
2. Even if an airport has an ILS, it is a very expensive system.

Perception is not different from language, IMO. Jeff Hawkins was right to say that ""vision is more like a song than a picture."" A perceptual hierarchy is composed of multiple sequences of sensory patterns. A compositional hierarchy is dynamic whereas a class hierarchy is rigid.

True, but over the road trucking has a very small percentage of regen opportunities throughout a typical route versus stop-and-go city driving which is where regen shines.  NKLA will have batteries even in their hydrogen trucks, so they have the same regen opportunities.

Until charge time is as fast as filling a 100 litre tank, EVs are a non starter. An EV with 40% charge parked at corner of a field is not going to make a parts run. A diesel pickup can fill before or during run in the fraction of the time.

Delaying ""battery day"" is not the same as delaying product or production.  FSD is another story. 

That said, if pro sports can play to empty stadiums and Belmont runs without spectators, you can have a freaking battery day w/o the crowds.  Most of us don't get to go anyway

Just for reference, Formula One cars go 0-60 MPH in 2.1 to 2.7 seconds on average, and ""occasionally"" accomplish it in 1.7 seconds. So a #Tesla Roadster Next Gen will indeed be fast off the line than a #FormulaOne car.

It actually does NOT, this is the drawback to Tesla's current implementation.  Car Key has a special super low power mode for the NFC chip that allows it to be used (also for Express Transit as well for City Transit gates) for up to 5 hours after the phone's battery is dead.

Really!  Power Reserve mode like they have on the Apple Watch that drives the hardware way down to bare minimum needs and slow clock CPU is used to support the NFC reader. They do this today for Transit already.  The Apple Watch has done this since day one to keep showing time.

You are quite right, as usual

TSLA is a true global play that no longer depends on the fluctuations and self-distractions of the U.S. economy

It brings the world to the investor in safer ways than the investor going out into the world alone

Logically over the next decade TSLA will map almost perfectly to where the world economy is most vibrant and active

By the nature of its product exposure TSLA will be both driving and benefiting on a global basis from the two most significant industries of the next two decades

Yeah, early on, I never had the issue in 2018, and then it started to appear sometimes to happened in 2019. At one point it was all the time, but then it went away and now it‚Äôs been every once in a while it happens.

I think it's possible, but initially I thought the plans for Tulsa would be for the future, like 18-24 months away. Austin would get a 2020 factory. Now, I'm less certain. Tulsa is excited, Austin seems lukewarm at best. Maybe Austin gets some leftovers in 18 months

Yes. We didn‚Äôt shut down Tesla to protect Tesla workers, but to slow general spread. When your workplace reopens, you have to return. You don‚Äôt get to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel safe‚Äù and collect UI. That‚Äôs totally impossible, for reasons that should be obvious to any thinking person.

The materials in batteries don't get used up like fossil fuels. At the end of their useful lifespan, all of the material is still there ready to be recycled. The impacts are a drop in the bucket compared to mining fossil fuels and dumping them into the atmosphere.

Nope. I'm in the UK & we get this all the time, dealers tell buyers they can use Tesla chargers .. but they mean destination chargers not superchargers. The non-Tesla won't negotiate with the supercharger & the power won't flow. If they need the charge they'll be disappointed

E Golf is the way to go for $, comfort, and range. Not a ridiculously long range, but they batteries last so much longer than a leaf. Standard is about 87 miles, but on eco+ mode you can get close to 120.

Only local driving for this car? If so, I'd go for an e-Golf (nicer ride) or the Leaf (cheaper). A second Model 3 would be a waste of money and a Bolt is more battery than you need to be lugging around for local use. e-Golf would probably win due to battery deg on the older Leaf.

it's a delicate balance of ""common sense"" which nobody has anymore, and ""personal freedoms"" which is in short supply too.  Teslas are also the safest cars you can be in; offsetting total risk exposure to: really inexperienced drivers that shouldn't be unlocking track mode.

Not just stranded assets. The oil industry makes about $2 billion every day, a large amount of which is attributable to gasoline. #EVs, as personified by

The next leg down in battery cost will come from production methods (i.e. cell to pack). Also market now seems to agree on battery chems, thus scaling production lines accordingly. Economies of scale most important, which is underway.

Considering how many people are not driving much these days, if you want to pamper your battery, charge to around 50-60% and drop the amperage down to around 18A, for more of a slow/trickle charge. Change it back to full power and the amount you need for any big trips.

Awesome result. Especially in the circumstances. Hopefully new Tesla battery tech will enable a genuinely affordable Tesla. Current models are far too expensive for most car buyers. This was very clear after I bought my Model 3 Performance. ""I can't afford that"" was all I heard.

Yes - the spacer comes with each purchase of a pad because it provides a big lip for the phones to rest on. Bigger than the V2 and others. If you use this with the OEM ridge, it's perfect.

Good for clearance, wired charging, and extra space for large phone cases.

Because the priority at Tesla for Musk is juicing the stock price. Hiring people to pick up the phone or properly servicing cars in a timely fashion need spending a lot of money, which can only add to the company's losses.

Unfortunately rear control is binary, the fan speed is tied to the front. In the Model 3 and Y I believe this is a physical limitation. It may also be physically limited in the S but I want to say it‚Äôs technically possible but not programmed (yet) in the Model X.

This is likely the last chance to enter long before the run up to $2,000! 

Invalidation of this bullish projection is a break below $1368.

As a current Tesla owner and former owner of four BMWs I can tell you the driving experience of a Tesla owner is superior in every way. Performance, technology and customer satisfaction. Glad BMW has roled out this tech but seriously this is nothing new.

If you can find some of the ""older"" models they came with unlimited charging as a benefit for being an early adopter. The charges follow the car, not the owner. A friend did this and bought an older Tesla. Hasnt paid for anything except normal stuff and tires since then

Get the Model 3 Standard Range Plus. It costs $38k, but will save you $1k per year on fuel. It‚Äôs RWD with 250 mile range. After 2.5 years of owning a Model 3, I‚Äôve come to the conclusion that 250 miles is more than enough. Stick with 18‚Äù wheels for best range, and basic Autopilot

If you don't need it for long trips get the SR #model3, it's the perfect daily driver. If you need it for trips get the #ModelY, it's the best all-around car in the planet. Best thing about Teslas, they get better over time with software updates. Plus cheap maintenance AND safe!

Yes, it is the Dual Motor variant. I've heard that the RWD isn't any more efficient. The 2nd motor is only used when needed, or the power is distributed in such a way that AWD does not carry an efficiency penalty... This is very unlike ICE cars.

Of course, if they're new cars, they won't be required to do roadworthiness tests. But they could still in theory be taken off the roads by the authorities for an obvious infraction like that if they were reported.

Just to be clear. You should never, ever, stay connected at a Supercharger overnight. It's bad for the rest of the Tesla owners, whether the location is full or not. Once your car is ready at the state of charge you want, unplug. Then, do whatever you want. Be a good Tesla owner.

Correct-it does have a cooling system. But also correct that it will charge/discharge faster when warmer. If you put in a Supercharger destination, it will start preconditioning the battery once you are within a certain range. And for discharge, my car feels faster @ these temps.

Also, Tesla's can be cheaper than $35k. Older Model S' are a good example, you can find them for sub-$30k. Don't forget about the robotaxi network planned a ways out. The cars made now with FSD will be a net-profit.

Not entirely sure. I've seen it happen while driving, as well as while charging. When charging one time,, I watched it go from 99% battery at 210mi to 100% at 190mi in just a matter of seconds. Seems it just gets confused sometimes. Luckily, its an easy fix (as seen above)

It would be really cool if Tesla would add in a energy details option that would display something like ""40kWh / 55kWh remaining"" but I'm not sure if it's even possible to guess the total capacity in the batteries without doing a full fill and drain to zero/near zero.

Timing may indeed be a problem for slow electrochemical neurons but not for a machine. My only argument in favor of a well-designed 3D topology has to do with learning speed. It's important to keep potentially related neurons close together to facilitate connection search.

Just in case you're serious (not trolling), please get educated about corporate finance, especially forward P/Es and company valuation in general. It's very upsetting to see someone using a single, irrelevant data point to give financial advice.

Sorry but this makes zero sense. Bike parking must be cost neutral but you are happy to subsidise car parking to the extent that

 owners can park for free? And a metal bike hangar which generates >¬£600 a year for the council is clearly more than covering its costs.

California‚Äôs big bet on renewables, and its shunning of natural gas and nuclear, is directly responsible for the state‚Äôs blackouts and high electricity prices.
