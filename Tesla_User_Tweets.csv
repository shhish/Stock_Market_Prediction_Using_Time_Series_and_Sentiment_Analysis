 needs to update map for “Hazardous Object/Vehicle Recognition”on the road, just like“Waze”to alert the driver ahead of time to react accordingly. Can disengage AP earlierto take control instead of reacting at last minute in panic mode. Trust AP or take control.

I can't see adding bidirectional charging adding much cost. Especially if it's on the DC side as all you do is close the contacts and have the inverter on the wall. Again, I'm mostly thinking load shifting. Off grid is another story.

It's 10 mile difference on random mileage number they picked. Never said anything was wrong, but considering I own M3 and have 2 reservations for Model Y, and my wife has MS, thought they could make exception.

Yes, how much does your car consume in one year to cover your driving needs?

When you calculate like 10% less consumption because of the heat pump you can see if it's worth to replace the car when you drive it for like 8 years or so. :)

Definitely check plugshare. On my trip in feb I slept in my car. Foam mattress with back seats down. So i slept at destination chargers at hotels. I won’t have the best advice. 

Only thing I’d say is that there are plenty of public chargers by Zion. Including at the v-center.

Thanks for the great metric. We'd prefer 3+Y but it's just too expensive. Even trading the 3 for the Y seems a bit too expensive. Obviously a luxury car in general is not the wisest use of funds, but increasing car payment for a slightly bigger but overall similar car... Eh

It should cut the heating power roughly in half, since it can harvest the heat generated by the motors. I the coldest month your range usually drops around 40% - if your not preheating the car before you leave.

On my typical 2hour drive to work, my M3LR AWD consumes about 450Wh/mi (20degree C)- but I'm not really slow with up to 130mph. When going more slowly like 85mph, consumption is still at approx. 350Wh/mi. Even if I try, I never had below 250Wh/mi on a typical German road mix.

My lifetime consumption is 290Wh/mile since getting it in October.  I’ve only charged it to 100% once for a 210 mile round trip to Canterbury and it had about 70 miles of range left when I got home. Range estimator currently says 305 miles if fully charged

I absolutely love my LR dual motor.  For my situation with no at home or at work charging and (in normal times) a 60 mile a day commute it allows me to still just get on with driving and not really worry about range at all. Well worth the extra. Plus it goes like stink

Could have bought any of them, chose the SR+. If you dont need the extra range the LR doesnt offer enough extra to be worth the money to me and I dont care about the 0-60 time.
Has full autopilot (FSD is a seperate thing) and the satellite map is a paid option on all models

My old 40kw Leaf had plenty of range despite my 60 mile commute so the SR+ is almost overkill.

I think raising the SR+ charge speed to 170kw made the LR slightly less attractive if you only occasional do long drives. If you regularly do more than 200 miles it's a no brainer tho

Once they have plenty of working capital with ramped production they can revisit aggressive lease terms. They need to build out factories before they float money with leases. 95% of sales are purchases which is unheard of (amazing) and they sell everything they can make.

Faster is a relative term. The Taycan charges to 80% slightly faster, but can't go as far as the Tesla when it's charged. So if you had to race to charge up for a 250-mile drive, the Tesla wins, because it charges faster.

Looks like 25 gCO2e/mile, and they state to be using a lifetime of 200.000 miles. Means 5000 kgCO2e for a Tesla Model 3 battery. Nothing about which size. If 75 kWh then its close to your unofficial 65 kgCO2e/kWh number.

New update includes mind reading!!!   Glad that your daily commute issues are solved. But I just updated to 2020.20.12...  the “take off from stop sign” when you can’t see doesn’t seem solved.  I tried “creep” and “roll” options instead of “hold” but no difference.

That just adjusts how the car behaves at low speeds. Creep mode will creep forward unless you press the break, roll mode is like you put the car in neutral, and hold mode stops completely and then brakes so it doesn’t roll.

Nkla is shoveling BS and yet the media / analysts consume the tag lines like it’s great for their consumption. Where’s the hydrogen fuel network?  Hydrogen fuel will continue to be higher cost vs the actual renewable energy source.

It's an amazing car.  I love my 3, but the Y has much more utility, due to its slightly larger size and rear hatch. If I didn't have a 3, the Y would be the one I would get.

Would it be possible/sensible that when stopped with auto-steer enabled, if an indicator is turned on, have auto-steer turn off until the driver has finished manually taking a turn and then put it back on again?

This would be a much smoother experience. Thanks

Timing is amazing along with the most significant single autopilot update in over a year.  Software 2020.20.13 adds automatic stopping for lights and stop signs.

You're right, poor service is awful and should be avoided. However, perfection is sadly near impossible, yet I've seen Tesla try harder to reach that goal than other OEs. I say this from having worked service for multiple brands, including Tesla.

True, but over the road trucking has a very small percentage of regen opportunities throughout a typical route versus stop-and-go city driving which is where regen shines.  NKLA will have batteries even in their hydrogen trucks, so they have the same regen opportunities.

 should do FSD with a 30 days money back guaranteed for the rest of Q2 and get a ton of that revenue for Q2. Q3 will not need any extra cash.

I would think the delay is to ramp up the new battery production and get them into vehicles prior to battery day. This will stop the Osborne effect on car sales and can be announced at BD through a software update. 400 mile model Y

Until charge time is as fast as filling a 100 litre tank, EVs are a non starter. An EV with 40% charge parked at corner of a field is not going to make a parts run. A diesel pickup can fill before or during run in the fraction of the time.

Delaying ""battery day"" is not the same as delaying product or production.  FSD is another story. 

That said, if pro sports can play to empty stadiums and Belmont runs without spectators, you can have a freaking battery day w/o the crowds.  Most of us don't get to go anyway

I agree competition is great.  
@LucidMotors
, for example, has stated they are ALLIES with Tesla.  IF I were

@Tesla

Gary, Tesla does not book your payment as revenue unless they deliver a car and signed paper. So they have utmost interest to find the inventory that matches your order soon. It is a logisticsl complication. I am sure u ll get yours on time $tsla

It actually does NOT, this is the drawback to Tesla's current implementation.  Car Key has a special super low power mode for the NFC chip that allows it to be used (also for Express Transit as well for City Transit gates) for up to 5 hours after the phone's battery is dead.

Really!  Power Reserve mode like they have on the Apple Watch that drives the hardware way down to bare minimum needs and slow clock CPU is used to support the NFC reader. They do this today for Transit already.  The Apple Watch has done this since day one to keep showing time.

TSLA is a true global play that no longer depends on the fluctuations and self-distractions of the U.S. economy

Don’t change the order they will change to the latest prices. We changed just our color and lost any savings we might have realized due to putting down a $2500 deposit. Lesson learned. Make sure you do what’s right for you, because Tesla will do what’s right for them.

Yes. We didn’t shut down Tesla to protect Tesla workers, but to slow general spread. When your workplace reopens, you have to return. You don’t get to say “I don’t feel safe” and collect UI. That’s totally impossible, for reasons that should be obvious to any thinking person.

The materials in batteries don't get used up like fossil fuels. At the end of their useful lifespan, all of the material is still there ready to be recycled. The impacts are a drop in the bucket compared to mining fossil fuels and dumping them into the atmosphere.

Nope. I'm in the UK & we get this all the time, dealers tell buyers they can use Tesla chargers .. but they mean destination chargers not superchargers. The non-Tesla won't negotiate with the supercharger & the power won't flow. If they need the charge they'll be disappointed

Short sellers don't remove transparency or liquidity. If the markets aren't properly functioning, and I would agree to an extent they aren't, it has nothing to do with legitimate short selling. Look at the tireless work short sellers put into Wirecard for example.

Rich is a great advertisement for Tesla. He shows what great about them as well as the little niggles and faults. No company is perfect and to try and hide mistakes just means that when it eventually comes out the result is worse.

I have nothing against Rich he does cool stuff but he has to be aware how inspiring a bunch of people to buy and modify salvaged Teslas can be problematic. Complaining about Re-certification, when its a matter of safety & quality control seems silly.

That's it's own discussion. Software is involved now. Aftermarket tuning is massive. No other automaker tries to control it like Tesla. Many cars can have their firmware modified to boost performance.

Shirts and performance upgrades are entirely different. His upgrades essentially make it so you don’t need to buy a Performance Model 3, if that caught enough traction it could seriously hurt Tesla and it’s shareholders. Not the same as aftermarket add-ons for performance cars

Pretty sure Rich said that jokingly in one of his videos. It's weird that he would leave it as a comment on one of your videos, but he's also a bit of a troll... ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I've joked that the Model 3 isn't a real Tesla because the chrome trim actually lines up on some examples.

 If a Tesla is totaled, the owner/insurance would have to repurchase autopilot w/ replacemnt car. If Tesla would let owners transfer autopilot to replacement car, Tesla owners could back autopilot cost out of insurance thus pay a lower premium/save money.

Only local driving for this car? If so, I'd go for an e-Golf (nicer ride) or the Leaf (cheaper). A second Model 3 would be a waste of money and a Bolt is more battery than you need to be lugging around for local use. e-Golf would probably win due to battery deg on the older Leaf.

it's a delicate balance of ""common sense"" which nobody has anymore, and ""personal freedoms"" which is in short supply too.  Teslas are also the safest cars you can be in; offsetting total risk exposure to: really inexperienced drivers that shouldn't be unlocking track mode.

Not just stranded assets. The oil industry makes about $2 billion every day, a large amount of which is attributable to gasoline. #EVs, as personified by

I think that's why Mr Truck Rammer in Taiwan didn't avoid the accident. I suspect the overpass triggered AEB, so he hit the accelerator there, and left foot on it till the impact.

Considering how many people are not driving much these days, if you want to pamper your battery, charge to around 50-60% and drop the amperage down to around 18A, for more of a slow/trickle charge. Change it back to full power and the amount you need for any big trips.

The hardware was factory-installed in the early cars but is no longer installed in current Model 3 and Model Y. If you now purchase for $300 it’s not only a software activation but actually a hardware installation through the SC or Tesla Ranger Service.

If there is a will there is a way. I talk about cars a lot. All types and I always recommend Tesla naturally. But do think the new mustang E is cool too.

Caveat emptor JKA

When one begs for Elon’s attention to attend to a vehicle issue ... you need to start with ‘I love my Tesla but’

You still won’t get any recognition from Elon or Tesla, but you are telling the cult you are here for cause, the future, the mission

Yes - the spacer comes with each purchase of a pad because it provides a big lip for the phones to rest on. Bigger than the V2 and others. If you use this with the OEM ridge, it's perfect.

Good for clearance, wired charging, and extra space for large phone cases.

I only got as far as trying to buy one, and that was enough for me. Gave up in the end because of total (and I mean total!) lack of communication.

Musk can send a Roadster to Mars but his car company can’t even send an email or text message to keep customers updated!

Shambolic.

Unfortunately rear control is binary, the fan speed is tied to the front. In the Model 3 and Y I believe this is a physical limitation. It may also be physically limited in the S but I want to say it’s technically possible but not programmed (yet) in the Model X.

I wonder what other car manufacturers were like after only a decade or so? You’re comparing ICE vehicle manufacturers that have had 10x the time to refine their processes. What you should question is why they stuck with ICE for so long when they could have innovated.

It exudes power and strength, but not very much elegance. In my eyes, the S3XY lineup is as mich about being sleek and refined as it is about tearing ICE cars a new one. Entirely a different beast from the cybertruck.

Why even make someone watch a video?  A simple text from the App saying ""You're currently at 80% charge, please remember the charge rate gets much slower past 80% and even slower past 90% so you would reach your destination faster by leaving now"" or something similar

A decline in the sales of Model 3 means either:

1) Demand for the car has disappeared

There's plenty of data that shows that per mile Tesla's are safer than avg car, and much safer with autopilot. They've clocked in tens of millions of miles into their data logs. Evidence is pretty conclusive.

Get the Model 3 Standard Range Plus. It costs $38k, but will save you $1k per year on fuel. It’s RWD with 250 mile range. After 2.5 years of owning a Model 3, I’ve come to the conclusion that 250 miles is more than enough. Stick with 18” wheels for best range, and basic Autopilot

Also, I find that most people don’t truly understand what owning/driving a Tesla is truly like. Test drives at a showroom are great, but going for a ride with an owner/friend may be the best way to gain an understanding about what these cars can really do.

My Tesla calculates range down to the mile every minute of driving.
Its WAAAAAY more accurate than the guess-o-meter in a smoking car.

I've driven right down to mile 0 in my car, and charged it right back up just the same. I'm told about 10 miles are possible past 0 even slowly.

I've done numerous long distance trips in our IONIQ. Probably about half the range of Steve's Tesla but we've never had any major issues. Just a bit more planning needed but the drive is much more relaxed and a whole lot cheaper! Not sure how US infrastructure compares to UK.

They’re not destroying these companies before they get off the ground, they simply have put the time and work in that is necessary to produce an EV that sells well. If these companies had karasmatic CEOs and a good product, they would follow suit, but they don’t. Blame Tesla tho

Just to be clear. You should never, ever, stay connected at a Supercharger overnight. It's bad for the rest of the Tesla owners, whether the location is full or not. Once your car is ready at the state of charge you want, unplug. Then, do whatever you want. Be a good Tesla owner.

My point is that it does not alert you with a badge like when the tire pressure is low.

Correct-it does have a cooling system. But also correct that it will charge/discharge faster when warmer. If you put in a Supercharger destination, it will start preconditioning the battery once you are within a certain range. And for discharge, my car feels faster @ these temps.

If today’s model S had a 130kWh battery pack, it’d be about the same range as Lucid. That’s not even considering the more efficient powertrain and batteries that’ll be revealed next month, so I don’t see how it beats Tesla from a range perspective that can’t be replicated

Timing may indeed be a problem for slow electrochemical neurons but not for a machine. My only argument in favor of a well-designed 3D topology has to do with learning speed. It's important to keep potentially related neurons close together to facilitate connection search.

If I was getting an MBA and I had to write a thesis, it would be on Tesla fans' compulsion (hoping to get his attention/blessing) to tag Elon/Tesla in the photos they tweet, and the impact resulting torrent of notifications and noise has on Elon Musk's daily productivity.

My conspiracy theory: Lucid very clearly did not want to be a Tesla killer.  And if they had solid state battery tech, and brought it to Tesla, Tesla could manufacturer it.  And would not complain about another EV having longer range.

California’s big bet on renewables, and its shunning of natural gas and nuclear, is directly responsible for the state’s blackouts and high electricity prices.
